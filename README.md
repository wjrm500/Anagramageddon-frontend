### What this game is

Anagramageddon is a real-time multiplayer territory-control word game for 2-4 players. The core gameplay loop:

1. Territory expansion: On your turn, click any grid square adjacent to territory you already own (including diagonals). This claims that square's letter.
2. Word formation: After claiming a square, you must form a valid English word using only the letters you currently own. Words score points equal to their length.
3. Victory: First player to reach the target score wins (with a fairness mechanic: if you hit the target but an opponent has a pending turn with enough letters to potentially tie/beat you, they get to play first).

### Key Mechanics:

- Stealing: you can claim squares owned by opponents, taking their letters
- Locking: click your own square to add a lock (up to 3). Locked squares can't be stolen until each lock is removed by an opponent clicking it on their turn
- Time pressure: each turn has a countdown (5-30 seconds configurable)
- Volatile boxes (optional): random squares shake and change letters periodically
- Letter frequency: letters spawn based on English frequency distribution (E most common, Z rarest)
